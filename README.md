ClixxDock
=========

This project is an attempt to simplify the process of experimenting with
electronics projects using an IBM compatible computer running Windows by
providing a USB controlled docking station for the [Clixx.IO](http://clixx.io/)
rapid prototyping system as well as an open source .NET library to communicate
with the Clixx peripherals.

ClixxDock Hardware
==================

This directory contains the schematic and layouts for the ClixxDock controller
board. The controller is based on the [LPC1114FN28](http://www.nxp.com/products/microcontrollers/cortex_m0_m0/LPC1114FN28.html)
ARM Cortex M0 CPU made by NXP Semiconductors. The controller board is fully
supported by the [ClixxLib](https://github.com/thegaragelab/clixxlib) C++ library
and can be used as a standalone controller for Clixx peripherals as well.

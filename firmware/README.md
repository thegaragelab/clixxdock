ClixxDock Firmware
==================

This provides the source code for the firmware loaded onto the embedded CPU
found in the ClixxDock control circuitry. The firmware is based on the
[ClixxLib](https://github.com/thegaragelab/clixxlib) C++ library and provides
a simple ASCII based protocol to allow the dock to be controlled by a separate
host computer.

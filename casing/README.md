Docking Station Casing
======================

This folder contains the [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) source files
needed to generate the STL models for the 3D printing docking station cases.
These can be printed yourself, sent to a service like [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/)
or printed at your local Makerspace.
